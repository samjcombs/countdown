# countdown
Simple bash 90m work counter downer.

## Overview

Welcome to the 90-Minute Countdown Timer! This simple bash script is designed to help you manage your work or practice sessions effectively by leveraging the science behind optimal productivity intervals. The script sets a 90-minute timer, which is followed by a short break, creating an efficient cycle to maximize focus and productivity.

## Usage

To run the countdown timer, simply execute this script in your terminal:

```bash
./fun-work-time
```

The script will start a 90-minute countdown. Once the time is up, you'll be notified to take a break before starting your next session.

## The Science Behind 90-Minute Sessions

### Ultradian Rhythms

Human productivity and focus are governed by natural cycles known as ultradian rhythms. These cycles typically last about 90-120 minutes, during which our brains can maintain high levels of focus and performance. By aligning your work or practice sessions with these natural rhythms, you can harness the peak periods of cognitive efficiency.

### Research Findings

Several studies have demonstrated the benefits of working in 90-minute intervals:

1. **Increased Focus and Productivity**: Research by Anders Ericsson, a prominent psychologist, found that top performers in various fields (from music to sports) often work in focused 90-minute sessions. This approach allows for deep work and minimizes the fatigue associated with prolonged periods of continuous effort.
2. **Improved Learning and Skill Acquisition**: A study published in the journal *Psychological Science* highlighted that shorter, focused sessions with breaks in between lead to better retention and understanding of new information. This method prevents cognitive overload and promotes sustained attention.
3. **Better Work-Life Balance**: Incorporating regular breaks into your routine not only boosts productivity but also enhances overall well-being. Breaks provide a necessary respite, allowing your mind to recharge and reducing the risk of burnout.

### Practical Implementation

To implement this strategy effectively:

* **Work for 90 Minutes**: Focus intensely on your task for a 90-minute period. Eliminate distractions and immerse yourself fully in the work.
* **Take a Short Break**: After each session, take a 10-15 minute break. Use this time to relax, stretch, or engage in a non-work-related activity. This break is crucial for maintaining your energy levels and preparing for the next session.
* **Repeat the Cycle**: Continue this cycle throughout your day to maintain high levels of productivity and focus.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the script according to your preferences. You can adjust the duration of the work sessions and breaks to suit your individual needs and rhythm.
